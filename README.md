## Description
I refactored a CMS. Starter code was provided by instructor and we had to get several features up and running. These features included the a login with authentication system, CRUD features on posts, and simple user friendly navigation.


## How to Use

Users may sign up for an account or use a dummy account.

Dummy Account Login is
Username: ryan
Password: password

Once a account is created, users will be routed to the dashboard page. On the dashboard page, new users are able to create a new post. Existing users may create, view, update, or delete posts associated with their account.

Users may then view posts from other users on the homepage. User may logout and still view posts from other users on the homepage, but are no longer able to create new posts.

## To Do List
1. More responsive create button - not UX friendly


## Tools Used
JawsDB / MySQL
Handlebars

## Access

Users can access the application via the Heroku Link. Users may view the code via Github.
